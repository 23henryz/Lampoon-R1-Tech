# Lampoon-R1-Tech

Name: Henry Zhou

Physical Address on Campus: Matthews Hall South 106

Completed October 7th. This project is for the Lampoon Tech Comp R1 using OCR ML for Imaginary Friends and creating a spoof site for Linkedin. 

How I did it: 

For the transcription, I did a preliminary OCR ML script which transcribed all the text. However, I was having trouble with detecting the start and finish of articles so I did it by page and switched that manualy (its an easy switch because most pages only has one) and also checked for any errors that I corrected.

For the spoof site, I created a static website using the style of linkedin. I only added the necessary features that I deemed useful. For many of the buttons, I used javascript to add the ability to bring the user back to the home page or the sound of a beep on click - this is to show that I have the capability of adding an alternative interaction if necessary. For the like button, I decided to do something fun and make it increase count 1 when you like. I wrote some hopefully humorous articles and stories to accompany the website - hope you enjoy.
