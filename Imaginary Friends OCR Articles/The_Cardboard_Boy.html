    <h3>The Cardboard Boy</h3>

    <p>After years of begging my parents for a younger sibling, they finally relented and gave me my very own cardboard boy.</p>

    <p>The first night the cardboard boy stood upright in my room, I couldn’t fall asleep because I was so excited. I would never be alone again! For the first time in months I didn’t fantasize about hanging myself from my ceiling fan.</p>

    <p>The cardboard boy instantly became my best friend. I tried to show him many of my favorite things, like eating and playing soccer. He couldn’t really eat, since he was cardboard, and when I took him outside to play soccer, the ball would bump limply off of him. I decided that he would probably be best at goalie.</p>

    <p>All of the other children in the neighborhood were afraid of him, considering they had never played soccer with a cardboard boy before. They were also confused about why he had so many silvery stains on him. He was a great goalie!</p>

    <p>One day, when I woke up, the cardboard boy was no longer in my arms in bed with me. He was missing. I wondered for a long time whether he had run away, or if cardboard God had called him home to cardboard heaven.</p>

    <p>When I asked my parents what happened, they told me that they had thrown him out in the town dumpster and that it was unbecoming for a high school senior to spend so much time with an inanimate object. “If he’s inanimate then I’m inanimate!” I screamed at them.</p>

    <p>For three days, I was so depressed about his death that I couldn’t move.</p>

    <p>Then my parents got me a vape pen and everything was fine again.</p>
