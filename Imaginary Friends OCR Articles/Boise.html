    <h3>Boise</h3>

    <p>Charles: The best way to cross the street in Boise, Idaho, is to yell “Gun! Gun! Gun!” and wave a gun while you sprint through the traffic. That’s the kind of advice you receive should I be elected mayor of this great city.</p>

    <p>Oliver: Now wait a secon–</p>

    <p>Charles: My rival on this stage, Oliver *growls and shakes fist*, wants you to believe that the best way to improve Boise is to create a fire department.</p>

    <p>Crowd: Boooooo!</p>

    <p>Charles: That’s right! That’s not the Boise way! *barks a few times* You know what we say to that, Oliver?</p>

    <p>*Charles spits on the ground in front of Oliver*</p>

    <p>Crowd: Woooohoooo!</p>

    <p>Charles: Fuck you, Oliver! Also, my first act as mayor would be to declare Boise an independent country!</p>

    <p>Oliver: Listen, Charles. We can compromise! I suggest we institute a fire department that also carries guns.</p>

    <p>Charles: Shut up! I’ve had enough of this. I’m going to blow you up… with my mind!</p>

    <p>Crowd: Ooooooooohhh!!! Aaaaahhhh!!</p>

    <p>*Charles puts his fingers to his temples, closes his eyes, and starts grunting and squirming*</p>

    <p>Crowd: BLOW HIM UP!! BLOW HIM UP!!</p>

    <p>Charles: ARGHGHAGAHAAGGGHGHHH</p>

    <p>*Charles starts bleeding from his nose and eyes*</p>

    <p>Oliver: You know… I think I’ll just drop out.</p>
