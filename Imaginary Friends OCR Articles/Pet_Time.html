    <h3>Pet Time</h3>

    <p>I’ve got a real bone to pick with the director of my hometown’s school system. After someone threatened to blow up the sports shed after getting a bad grade on their test, their main change was deciding everyone should get some kind of pet or emotional support animal. They ended up having to cut science and math programs to afford buying everyone dogs and then goldfish when the money began to run low. In the spirit of efficiency, they then took all funding away from the English and history departments after they hypothesized that the emotional intelligence we’d get from taking care of the animals entirely negated any need for a grounding in the humanities.</p>

    <p>At that point going to school pretty much just entailed sitting in a parking lot with all the other students and playing with your animal, which was honestly very fun. Our college admissions stats for 2028 turned out pretty disastrously, though, with one student getting into RISD and all the others getting sent to some place called the Lumberjack Academy, and the school board quickly realized they’d have to pivot in a different direction.</p>

    <p>At this point they finally landed on their genius current plan of making the emotional support pets imaginary, rather than actually buying real animals. The animals had already been purchased, though, so the school had to herd them all together and send them off to the incinerator. Meanwhile, the students sat down in front of the animals. I was trying to be a real wiseass and show off my irreverent, devil-may-care attitude in front of the hot pedagogical review lady the State of California sent to oversee our classes, so I picked a pet rock. I assumed we’d get to change it at some point, but it turns out that since the removal of the humanities department at my campus, critical and creative reasoning had entirely gone down the toilet, leaving me unable to imagine anything outside my immediate visual field. I opened my mouth and closed it a couple times like some kind of aquatic animal I was at that moment unable to picture, and then resigned myself to having an imaginary pet rock.</p>

    <p>All the other kids were really cruel about it, too. After class we all walked outside, and it was just a constant stream of all the cool things their imaginary pets were doing. “Mine just jumped over that concrete wall!” “Mine just flew loops around the cafeteria and then did my homework!” (The other kids are not particularly well-adjusted either). I was forced to watch all this, and whenever anyone asked about my pet I’d just shrug and sort of mime the rock just sitting there. Any other response would have strained the shared concept of imaginary pets and made the other children hate me.</p>

    <p>I try and look on the bright side – even an imaginary pet rock can keep me company in hard times – but it’s sort of tough because even by the standards of other imaginary pets, mine is admittedly just so much worse.</p>
