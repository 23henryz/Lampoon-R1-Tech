    <h3>Flying</h3>

    <p>For who will love the bird if it cannot fly? — Anonymous</p>

    <p>I step into the elevator. The stinky elevator boy looks up at me with his sad, watery eyes. I toss him a few pennies and tell him to bring us up to the penthouse suite floor. “The penthouse, mister?” he asks me. “Yes, child. Take me to the top,” I answer.</p>

    <p>When I reach the penthouse, I find my pride and joy—my birdsuit—in the middle of my apartment. I trace my fingers over its feathery exterior, my mind pregnant with orgasmic expectation—after twenty-eight years of being a ground-dweller, I will fly.</p>

    <p>After putting on the suit and covering ninety-six percent of my body, I look across the interminable chasm that separates my penthouse from the glowing high rise in the distance where she lives. I wonder if she can see me, standing on the windowsill, makeshift wings strapped to my arms. I wonder if she expects me to fly.</p>

    <p>My whole life, I wanted to be a bird. I remember distinctly the days when I would ask my girlfriend to chew up my food and spit it into my mouth. “Feed me, mama,” I would whisper. And mama would oblige. But she didn’t love me. If she loved me, she wouldn’t have refused to kiss me when I wore the prosthetic beak. She would have let me make our home a tree, and our bed a nest. She preferred her high rise.</p>

    <p>I look down at the thousands of tenements at the base of the skyscraper, and feel the wind wrap around me. Many nights I sat up here, watching the poor scurry around like little ants. I imagined them shivering and starving, lusting for a mere morsel of bread. I pity them, I really do. They will never fly like daddy.</p>

    <p>I lean forward and take a deep breath. If I want any chance at reaching the high rise, let alone her room, I need to flap one hundred and fifty times per minute. That’s almost three hundred times per two minutes. Or six hundred times per one minute.</p>

    <p>Watch me, I call to the void, watch as Man-bird takes flight for the very first time. I leap from the makeshift platform on my windowsill. For a moment—for a single, fleeting moment—I am flying, buoyed by the wind under my wings, by my own unashamed and unwavering belief. I am a bird, and the world is mine to explore.</p>

    <p>Then my wings come apart in the wind. Apparently adding extra feathers, electrical tape, and an eighty pound kevlar vest (in case of shooting-related emergencies) to an old bird costume from seventh grade drama class isn’t exactly conducive to flying. Screaming and falling through the air, I am saved only by hitting a dormant crane and my world goes dark.</p>

    <p>I wake up in a hospital room surrounded by my laboratory colleagues. They give me various gifts and food, none of which I can chew and break down on my own. That’s when she comes through the door, wearing the feather-dress I had bought her so many years ago.</p>

    <p>“I love you, Robert,” she says, tears in her eyes. “I always have.” She puts on her prosthetic beak. “It’s always been you.”</p>

    <p>And for the first time, dear friend, I am able to fly.</p>
