    <h3>Cool Guy Carl</h3>

    <p>I walk into the YMCA gym, and two pushups in I’m already talking to Carl. Score!</p>

    <p>“Discovered a new planet today. Named it Mars. No one’s ever seen it before. It’s red.”</p>

    <p>Fucking Carl! I want to tell him that I still have two to three more pushups to do, but when I look up from my resting position (lying flat facedown on the floor with my arms by my side, palms up), he’s sprinting at full speed away from me. God he’s cool.</p>

    <p>After two more pushups, Carl’s back, but he’s got a cape with his face on it now. “I… got us… Funyuns,” he tells me, clearly trying to not show how out of breath he is. I go to grab a bag, but he slaps my hand away. “Not so fast, watch this,” he says. I watch as he crushes all of the Funyuns up, then opens the bag to reveal that he’s somehow shaped them into a perfect replica of my head. “I learned that little trick on the streets,” he tells me. “Which streets?” I ask him longingly.</p>

    <p>“Broadway, baby!”</p>

    <p>Everyone at this YMCA wants him sexually and physically—they want to keep him. Time to make my move. “Hey, I heard a fun fact about the YMCA is they let you sleep here if you hide in the pool while they close, because the janitors are too lazy to check under all of the water. You wanna stay over with me?”</p>

    <p>“I have a few haircuts tonight, so I don’t think I’ll be able to make it.”</p>

    <p>Fuck.</p>

    <p>Ever the conversationalist, Carl senses the lull and moves on quickly: “I invented a contraption, it’s like a flat fork you can use to eat cereal.” He’s so smart. All the other people in the YMCA know it, so I have to fight them off. It’s pretty easy though because I have a gun and they don’t.</p>

    <p>“I have to stay inside this YMCA forever because last time I left I was overrun by feral hogs,” Carl tells me. “They’re attracted to my musk.” Somehow he’s put on multiple pairs of sunglasses since his last sentence. “Anyways, stay cool, I’ll see you around and about.”</p>

    <p>And just like that, the most fuckable person in the YMCA disappeared into the ceiling panels, not to emerge for another few days.</p>
