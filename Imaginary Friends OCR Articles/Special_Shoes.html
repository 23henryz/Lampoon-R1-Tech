    <h3>Special Shoes</h3>

    <p>The Dreammaker: Give them a try, Timmy.</p>

    <p>Timmy: Okay, Mr. Dreammaker. But, again, I’m paralyzed. You really promise these shoes are going to make things better?</p>

    <p>The Dreammaker: Trust me. You have my word, you won’t be disappointed.</p>

    <p>Timmy: Alright. Wow! I—I don’t feel anything.</p>

    <p>The Dreammaker: Are you sure about that?</p>

    <p>Timmy: I can try walking but...oof, no, I’m definitely still paralyzed. Can you help me back up into my wheelchair?</p>

    <p>The Dreammaker: No, I mean don’t you feel excited to have some brand new Air Jordans?</p>

    <p>Timmy: So these are just regular Jordans?</p>

    <p>The Dreammaker: Well, they’re not just any Jordans. These are unreleased.</p>

    <p>Timmy: Aren’t you going to help me walk?</p>

    <p>The Dreammaker: Ha, come on now, Timmy. I’m not a doctor. Man, those Jordans look so rad!</p>

    <p>Timmy: Oh my god. I’m actually going to be paralyzed forever.</p>

    <p>The Dreammaker: Hey, bud, let’s get that frown out of town! Say cheese for the camera.</p>

    <p>Timmy: I can’t believe it. This is all just some sick publicity stunt. I should’ve listened to that kid who had cancer.</p>

    <p>The Dreammaker: You mean that kid who had cancer and some pretty awesome Jordans.</p>

    <p>Timmy: I actually think he had the same type of Jordans as me. Are these even unreleased?</p>

    <p>Cashier: Sir, I need to ring you up again for those used Jordans. Your credit card was declined.</p>

    <p>The Dreammaker: Hm? Oh, darn, Timmy, I think I’ve got to get out of here and make someone else’s dreams come true now. But remember, never give up, and always follow your dreams!</p>

    <p>Timmy: This is so messed up. I—I honestly don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to trust anyone again.</p>

    <p>Cashier: Really, kid, someone needs to pay for those Jordans.</p>
