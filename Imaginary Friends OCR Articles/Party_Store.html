    <h3>Party Store</h3>

    <p>Jim: Hey, Dave? You know that unicorn piñata we just filled?</p>
    <p>Dave: Mhm.</p>
    <p>Jim: Well I think we might’ve accidentally filled it using the bee pile instead of the can</p>
    <p>Dave: Oh, man.</p>
    <p>Jim: Dave, did you hear me? We put bees in a piñata. Little Tina’s piñata.</p>
    <p>Dave: At least we pulled from the dead bee pile.</p>
    <p>Jim: No Dave. The dead bee pile is huge still. We pulled straight from the live bees.</p>
    <p>Dave: Jim this is going to be pretty bad.</p>
    <p>Jim: Pretty bad? This is the third time this week. What are we going to do?</p>
    <p>Dave: I’m going to move the dead bee pile away from the licorice pile.</p>
    <p>Jim: Nevermind that right now. We have to fix—Dave, you’re getting dead bees everywhere.</p>
    <p>Dave: Sorry. It’s just really hard to move piles.</p>
    <p>Jim: It’s okay. Just clean the dead bees off before putting them—Jesus Dave, are you alright?</p>
    <p>Dave: Jim I think I’ve been eating live bees all day instead of chocolate.</p>
    <p>Jim: Dave your face is swelling terribly. Can you even breathe?</p>
    <p>Dave: Not much, Jim. I’m scared.</p>
    <p>Jim: Come on, Dave. Let’s get you to the hospital.</p>
    <p>Dave: I’m really not feeling too good, Jim.</p>
