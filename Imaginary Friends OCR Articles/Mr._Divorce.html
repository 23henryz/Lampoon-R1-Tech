    <h3>Mr. Divorce</h3>

    <p>Mr. Divorce is the newest superhero to roam the streets, and he’s no wuss. Mr. Divorce had one of the hardest upbringings there is, or at least that there is in a well-to-do upper-class suburban family from New England. No bones about it, Mr. Divorce is the fucking man. Here’s an example of how this legend stacks up against other heroes:</p>

    <p>Wussy wimpy ass lame hero: Uhh awww yeah aww fuck uhhh [ass kicked by passing midget]</p>
    <p>Mr. Divorce: I have dealt with a mild amount of adversity!</p>

    <p>Now, to be clear, Mr. Divorce’s parents are actually married. But when he was fifteen his friend Kyle’s parents broke up, and Mr. Divorce felt that for sure. Like I wouldn’t even mention it to him, like it was pretty bad man. Not only that, HE IS SUPERIOR IN EMOTION.</p>

    <p>Mr. Divorce can harness his negative experiences for SUPER-CHARGED EMOTIONAL SENSITIVITY. Here are some examples:</p>

    <p>Lame-ass wussy hero: Oh yeah</p>
    <p>MR. DIVORCE!!!!!: I just... I just can’t do this.</p>
    <p>Lame-wussy dude: Are you crying right now? We haven’t even started the mission.</p>
    <p>Woman: My parents got divorced, I need to talk to someone who can understand! [Mr. Divorce bangs this woman!]</p>

    <p>Mr. Divorce: I bet you’re not even gonna cry, you pussy.</p>
    <p>Unemotional robot-man: Why are you always bullying me about this?</p>
    <p>Mr. Divorce: Let’s not get into this.</p>
    <p>Fuck this guy: No, let’s. I am tired of being treated like your fucking doormat—</p>

    <p>MR. DIVORCE IS A MASTER OF EMOTIONALITY! He also has a black belt and can speak fluent Taekwondo! His dad has flown to nine different countries! His mother is almost Portuguese! The world is a seashell and the shell is his oyster! Oh, and in case you were wondering what this guy is like on his birthday:</p>
