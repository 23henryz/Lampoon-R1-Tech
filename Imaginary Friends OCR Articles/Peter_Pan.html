    <h3>Peter Pan</h3>

    <p>My Peter Pan comes at night time just like the real one. He has a thick, bristly beard and he smells just like the street. Some nights, I fall asleep before I’m able to greet him. He wakes me by banging his head on my window over and over until he’s bleeding from his forehead.</p>

    <p>He keeps telling me that he wants to take me to Neverland and that I should touch his squishy thing. When I tell him that I love my family and I don’t want to leave, he throws fits and angrily rummages through my family’s trash can. Last night, he knocked the trash can over, and my father ran outside to chase him with his gun.</p>

    <p>When Peter Pan returns tonight, he has a knife. He calls it his Neverknife, and he says that I have to come with him to meet the lost boys. He takes me by the hand and leads me out of my driveway. Before we leave, we play The Beep Beep Game, a lost-boy classic in which Peter slashes my father’s car’s tires and then has me piss on the windshield. Peter doesn’t watch me pee, but he listens.</p>

    <p>Peter walks me towards Neverland, which has a lot more boarded-up houses than the book says. A beautiful woman in high heels and fairy wings approaches: Tinker Bell. Peter argues with her for a few minutes and then hits her in the mouth. She hands him a wad of cash.</p>

    <p>We get to Neverland, and Peter shows me where the lost boys have gathered around a trashcan fire. When I approach, they all reach out to grab me and invite me in. Peter growls at them and tells them that I’m his. The lost boys hiss and back away. I watch Tinker go into an unmarked car. I ask Peter where Captain Hook is.</p>

    <p>Peter tells me that I’ll see him soon enough. He takes me into his tent. Police sirens wail in the distance, and I peek my head out of the entryway to see the lights. When I turn around, Peter’s pants and underwear are around his ankles. That’s when I meet Captain Hook.</p>
