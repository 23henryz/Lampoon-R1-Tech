    <h3>Shower Thoughts</h3>

    <p>How did I come up with the plan to locate the largest Al-Qaeda base in Northern Iraq? I’d been privately working on echolocating this compound for years, spending hours upon hours clicking to no avail and using GPS imaging to some avail. But still, it was an uphill battle.</p>

    <p>This was until one day I was having my early morning bath, scrubbing like hell, when the idea struck me. For the average joe this would be an ingenious idea, but for me, this was a classic “shower thought”. I snickered to myself as I finished up in the tub but by the time I’d toweled off, I had forgotten what the idea was completely. That day? September 10th, 2001.</p>

    <p>I’ve never forgiven myself for that. Ever since, I get my shower thought, I can’t afford to waste a single second more and I put my linen suit on my slick and dripping body and I dash to the office to put my new ideas to work before I forget. I show up soaking wet to work every day and that’s just the price I have to pay for the ideas. And before you even start, my boss loves it because saving what feels like billions of lives with my shower thoughts is worth a little soggy of a handshake. Gnats come to me more than ever.</p>

    <p>So basically, I was wet because I needed to be wet, and it’s a normal thing I have to do to prevent another tragedy. The thing that is lost on some of you is that…just because someone is wet does not mean they DESERVE to be electrocuted. When I came into work, I made an attempt to enjoy a single piece of toast in the defendant’s brand toaster, fuel for the ideas, and was instantly electrocuted. 100 volts. Nothing has been the same since. My hair stood straight up like a cartoon and my coworkers think I’m silly now. I also have irreversible damage to my nervous system. The thing is…I don’t even want your money, your blood money. I am simply asking for a few hundred dollars of moral money and that the defendant makes a toaster that is waterproof.</p>
