    <p>

    <p>
        ( ) The tragedy wiped out all the other candidates.
    </p>

    <p>The victims’ families are drowning in medical debt and water after sewage was cut from public programs. But have you noticed the answer bubbles for this survey look like drums?</p>

    <p>Forensics reveal the sinkhole that swallowed the hospital was triggered by a musical resonance that was just a tad flat. This couldn’t have been Mayor Jim, right?</p>

        ( ) If it was, I can’t prove it.
    </p>

    <p>
        ( ) Mayor Jim hopes they went to rock heaven.
