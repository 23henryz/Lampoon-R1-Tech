    <h3>Sleep Journal</h3>
    <p>I tried the Dymaxion sleep schedule where you take only four thirty-minute naps a day.</p>

    <p>While I had been awake for many hours, I felt, after just a 25 minute power nap, utterly rejuvenated. I began my monotonous work with a sense of renewed purpose. After just moments, not only was I writing four emails at the same time to different celebrities, but I was also dead asleep on my laptop keyboard and dreaming. The secret to this miracle program? The short naps trick your brain into entering a super-efficient emergency heal mode.</p>

    <p>When I awoke on my computer, drooling from my momentary nine-hour sleep, I checked the schedule. Wowa! Another 25 minute nap! Who said this was gonna be so hard! When I woke up from that nap, I felt amazing. If anything, I felt that I had been sleeping way too much.</p>

    <p>*****</p>

    <p>I open my computer. Ruh-roh. I have a lot of angry emails from work. No matter! They will be eating their wallets with jealousy when they hear that I kept a productive pace with just two thirty-minute naps, and one micro-nap that covered all the time in between. I try to tell them, but a frog is stopping me and he’s trying to sell me a clock but I won’t accept because he’s racist. And mom is here? What’s mom doing here? Oh, she is just selling me an idea about maximal productivity.</p>

    <p>*****</p>

    <p>I am now a master of work. In the few moments when I am not sleeping or looking tiredly out the window, I am capable of the most lucid, sleepiest, thoughts. Earlier today a cop tried to arrest me and I was able to fly away because it was a dream I was having. When my scalp talks I can hear it thinking. Today I am going to sleep all night. But not because I am abandoning the program. I am going to sleep in eighteen continuous and connected thirty minute naps.</p>

    <p>This will give me the super-emergency brain-healing I need to continue this path of the lone warrior, beholden to no man, sworn to no crown, slave to no fate, unclaimed by the winds, owner of no casino, bionicle of no bionicle...</p>
