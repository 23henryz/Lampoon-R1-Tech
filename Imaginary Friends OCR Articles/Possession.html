    <h3>Possession</h3>

    <p>Last Tuesday, my buddy Kyle was possessed by a demon. It happened when he grabbed a glowing red Bible off the sidewalk as we were heading back to the frat from Taco Bell. I called him a litter-picking-up bitch, but instead of laughing, Kyle keeled over and clutched his stomach, saying he didn’t feel so hot. No duh. Dude had just downed seven, eight chimichangas. Then his eyes turned black and his soul shot out of his mouth, along with some beans, all over my Bills jersey. I mean, seriously, bro, if you’re gonna hurl, turn the other way.</p>

    <p>Anyways, since that day (or “rebirth,” as Kyle likes to call it) he’s been a total pain in the ass. Whenever I ask him what’s up, he just says a lot of weird shit about how my parents are gonna die after the blood moon, and he keeps insisting that I call him Grædelwilth, servant of the underworld, even though I’ve told him that junior year is not the time for a rebrand.</p>

    <p>He’s also been way more of a cockblock than usual. At Delta on Friday, I was doing this sick party trick where I blow on a deck of cards and the cards go, like, everywhere—but then Kyle came in and recited some ancient runes which set half the people in the place’s eyeballs on fire, and of course the blonde whose phone number I was trying to get went home with him instead.</p>

    <p>But that’s not to say that Kyle turning evil has been all bad. Our new pledge class has two guys from the basketball team and six hundred and sixty-six from something called the Order of Lucifer, which is sick since we were starting to get pegged as a hockey frat. And his switch from vodka Gatorades to lamb’s blood has meant there’s way more alc for the rest of us, plus I’m also of course super happy and stuff that Kyle is getting sober.</p>

    <p>He’s even made up for the cockblock stuff by landing us a ton more attention from goth chicks. Last night, Kyle and I doubled with this reclusive gray-haired woman and her hot roommate at Chili’s. When the waiter came to take our order, Kyle’s gaze caused the guy’s body to burst out in boils and explode, making the roommate shriek and jump into my arms. Way to wingman, dawg.</p>

    <p>Back at our place, Kyle and his date interlocked their fingers and began chanting, opening the gates of Hell in the middle of our kitchenette. As screams and lava bursts emanated from the nether realm, Kyle sprouted giant, leathery wings. Then he ripped the old woman’s head off, let out a deathly cry that warned of the impending apocalypse, and flew her body into the abyss, the portal closing behind him in a gigantic fireball. “Wow,” I said from the next room, too busy with my date to really pay attention to Kyle. “This is the best handjob I’ve ever had.”</p>
