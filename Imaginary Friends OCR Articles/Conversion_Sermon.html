    <h3>Conversion Sermon</h3>

    <p>Why should you believe in God? Well, let me flip that question around. Why shouldn’t you believe in God? Never asked that, huh? Well, off the top of my head, I would venture that science has a pretty good theory of the universe’s origin, and the Bible is full of blatant inaccuracies. Okay, fine, but is that not reason to believe in something, merely because it is not well-substantiated by evidence? If that was true, then I would not be currently convinced that Leap Day was a hoax invented by Big Calendar to sell longer calendars, but I am.</p>

    <p>Hmm. Still not convinced. You know what, I will tell you a story that has a 100 percent conversion rate. We call it the Instant Convertor. Everyone who’s heard this story is instantly converted or sets their balls on fire. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. It’s called Pascal’s Gamble. Basically this guy Pascal has got all his money invested in a single blackjack game, and he says hit me. And the dealer said are you a madman?! You’re at 20 and everyone else is at 18 at best, you’re guaranteed to win! And Pascal said hit me, and if you don’t hit me I’ll shred your balls wise guy! And then Pascal, slick fucking bastard, got an ace right then and there. It was a pretty insane gamble—a huge risk with absolutely no reward. But that’s why we called him Crazy Pascal. That, and the fact that he did shred that dealer’s balls, even though he said he wouldn’t.</p>

    <p>I’m sorry what—you’re still not converted? Is this a practical joke? Is this one of those fake videos where you guys are revealed to be famous YouTube pranksters?! Seriously? Well I guess the first guy I told it to hadn’t really been converted, he was pretty religious beforehand too. Not sure if that counts. And the other guy, well I most certainly did light his balls on fire. So, okay, fine, it wasn’t a perfect scientific study on the effectiveness of the Pascal’s Gamble story.</p>

    <p>Speaking of science, here is this pamphlet on scientology. You know, people think scientology is some sick sort of organization that keeps all its information secret and steals your time and money. I would like to know if that’s true. All I know for sure is if I don’t hand out these pamphlets one of my kids will die.</p>

    <p>I’m going to start reading the Bible, just stop me when you feel a divine tingling. Alright here we go “God created the Earth in seven days.” Wait, what? That seems pretty unrealistic to me. Just digging a hole takes like ten hours. Alright, fine, let’s flip to another page. Oh yeah. Here is the good stuff: “Ashseesh, son of Bonak, son of Trefor, son of Zebog, son of Antnak, son of Tremor, King of Philistine, son of...” oh my god. Are you crying? Are you crying tears of religious ecstasy? Fine, I admit it. The Bible is not one of those love-at-first-sight kind of books. It’s more of a thinker. Like right now you’re all like “der doi doi god doesn’t exist der der” but later you’re going to be all like, “Holy shit, Tremor was the son of Ashish.” Just trust me on this one.</p>

    <p>I’m sorry, what did you say? Did you say God is the mightiest of all beings? I mean, I guess he’s kinda mighty. Maybe not the first thing that comes to mind when I think “mighty.” What, you think he’s mightier than me? Oh really?? You know, I could whoop that guy’s ass no problem. Are you kidding me???? I am the fucking lizard king. I will fuck that man’s shit up. God? Between you and me I bet he doesn’t exist. I bet he is a social construct critical to state cohesion! So yeah that guy is a total nonexistent figment of the imagination wuss. I could smoke him no problem.</p>

    <p>What did you say? Did you say you almost converted but I totally blew it? No, I’m not a failure. That’s not very nice. Excuse me? Why am I lowering this match while holding your exposed ballsack in my other hand? Oh, you think it’s because I am trying to conserve the conversion/balls-on-fire rate of the Pascal Gamble story since I realize this encounter has</p>
