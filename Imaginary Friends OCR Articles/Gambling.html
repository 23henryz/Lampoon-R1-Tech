    <h3>Gambling</h3>

    <p>Me: That’s what I told the bartender—you can’t drink Grey Goose if you’re gonna be a duck!</p>
    <p>My Friend: I still can’t believe that you won roulette eighteen times in a row. That’s a real life miracle.</p>
    <p>Me: It’s not a miracle, buddy. It’s confidence. Nobody’s got these titanium balls hanging from their underside, clanging like wind chimes in the breeze. Feel that breeze, friend. It follows me wherever I go.</p>
    <p>My Friend: I have confidence too… but eighteen times? The odds of that are infinitesimal.</p>
    <p>Me: Ha! The only thing infinitesimal is your ballsack. I can picture it now, clinging to your inner thigh, shivering and ashamed. If I went up against you in roulette or poker, my ballsack would eat your ballsack alive. That’s the truth of the matter, pal, the goddamned truth.</p>
    <p>My Friend: What are you talking about?</p>
    <p>Me: I have huge balls.</p>
