    <h3>Terrible No Good Very Bad Day</h3>

    <p>I woke up on the wrong side of the bed—underneath it. Then I started my day like I always do, which is putting on my hat before any other clothes in order to prepare for my job, which is being unemployed. Then I put on my pants, but I thought I put them on backwards and inside out the first time so then I took them off and switched them around and put them on again but it turned out they were the right way around the first time so then I had to switch them around again. Then I realized that my underwear was still on the bed so I had to start everything over.</p>

    <p>Next I went to find breakfast which I needed since the incident (my breakfast exploded), but I got hit by a bus almost immediately, but the impact threw me directly into the seat of another bus that was headed straight to the hospital. But then when I tried to stand up to get off of the bus it turned out I had sat in gum and it pulled me right back down again!</p>

    <p>At this point I realized I was late to meet my birth daughter for the first time (I am a sperm donor, my seed is spread far and wide). So I went to go meet her for lunch at Cracker Barrel but then I sat down next to her at a four person table! I hate myself! Also, the waiter was really rude. I asked her what people like to order here, and she said “I just work here. They work here too,” and then she pointed to the eight other people eating in the restaurant, four of whom looked exactly identical to her, and four of whom looked as unlike her as possible while still remaining human. Luckily, I had a good excuse to leave because I had to attend my improv class, which is from 9pm-9am. It’s a great deal because our coach doesn’t charge. He just has us practice by going out on the streets and making up different scenarios to the cops of Delaware.</p>

    <p>After improv I went to laser tag, but I lost in laser tag because my opponents were too wiley and spry, so I went to get a treat. Unfortunately the only treat available was rock candy, but my teeth can’t do crunching so I stuck that bad boy in the microwave and used a straw.</p>

    <p>While I was sucking up the rock candy through the straw, some of it dripped onto the ground, instantly fossilizing a few ants. When I looked down to investigate the scene, I saw that my pants were backwards. And inside out. Then a baby stole my candy.</p>
