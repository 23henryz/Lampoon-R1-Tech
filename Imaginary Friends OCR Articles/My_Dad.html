    <h3>My Dad</h3>

    <p>I wish I had a normal dad, but instead my dad is David Lynch. Everyday is a struggle because he only speaks in backwards to me but speaks normally to everyone else. “.otamoT .nos yad doog a evaH” This is what he says to me before he drops me off at school in his Ferrari, which is really just a bunch of cardboard taped to a Prius.</p>

    <p>My dad bothers me even when he’s not in the same room as me, especially since he donated “ominous essence” to my middle school. Even worse, he bought all my school supplies from some place called The Paradox Abyss, so whenever I write, the writing writes itself, and itself becomes the writing. I am failing all of my classes.</p>

    <p>Other kids go bowling or play catch with their dads, but the only game my dad wants to play is “utter until the whispers of the void reveal their secrets.” He wins everytime. We also arm wrestle sometimes but with our metaphysical bodies. We do this by sitting next to each other and closing our eyes and grunting occasionally until one of us says “I win.” He’s really bad at that one.</p>

    <p>I can never invite my friends over because my dad sometimes takes their consciousness and replaces it with an illusion. This means that their thoughts vanish and their eyes turn into spirals like Looney Tunes characters.</p>

    <p>Since I have lost all of my friends to the liminal void, I spend all my birthdays with only my dad. Every year I hope he gives me balloons and cake, but instead he gives me shadows. One time, I requested a clown for my birthday but instead he just brought some woman named Mildred.</p>

    <p>Even though my dad isn’t always the best, I try not to take him for granted. I’m sure other kids have it worse, like Christopher Nolan’s kid who has to go through each day in non-chronological order.</p>
