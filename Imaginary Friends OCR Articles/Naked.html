    <h3>Naked</h3>

    <p>You know that nightmare that people have where they show up to school and they’re completely naked? That nightmare is literally my life because everyday I show up to school, and I am completely naked. I don’t know how it happens, but I’ve narrowed it down to two theories:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I forget to put on clothes every day.</li>
        <li>Government officials have deemed me too serious of a threat, and, in order to neutralize my natural charisma with the masses, they disintegrate my clothes at approximately 8:29 AM every morning right before the first period bell rings.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Unfortunately, these are both equally likely possibilities, and I have made no progress past this point. You would think that maybe it’s an issue with the clothes themselves, but that has experimentally been proven wrong. I own opaque clothes. I own see-through clothes. And no matter their transparency level, the clothes are never on my body when I enter a learning facility.</p>

    <p>I would say that this phenomena has ruined my life, but it actually has had absolutely no impact on my social life whatsoever. For starters, because of the reverse-pedophile effect, teachers and administrators are too afraid to say anything. In addition, most students’ first thought when I stroll into class butt-naked is “I really think you should get that giraffe-shaped mole on your ass checked out.” Sometimes people think the mole looks more like a renovated condominium, but either way, they’re too worried about me developing cancer to bully me for my scrawny and luminescent build.</p>

    <p>My academics, on the other hand, have taken a turn for the worse because I’m just super chilly all the time and can never focus on class because of the chill. People tell me to put a jacket over my naked clothes-less body, but what’s the point? I have no clothes on. How would putting on a jacket change anything?</p>

    <p>I honestly don’t know what to do, but also I’m lowkey not that invested in figuring this out because it only inconveniences my life ever so slightly. My besties have told me that I’m cursed, but that seems unlikely. After all, I’m on great terms with the naked wizard that lives behind my house.</p>
