    <h3>Macy and Lacy</h3>

    <p>Help! I’m being haunted by the ghosts of two evil twin girls. They work together to terrorize me in different but ultimately complementary and equally awful ways. Every night before bed, Macy whispers in my ear that she is going to brutally murder me with an ax. Just as I am drifting off to sleep, Lacy tells me that I look fat in my Victorian nightgown. I lie awake at night wondering if I’ll live to see the morning and if it’s even worth it when clearly no one likes me and I’m not even pretty.</p>

    <p>Today is an especially bad day. It’s the anniversary of Macy’s murder, so she is seeking blood as a form of vengeance. It’s also the anniversary of the day Lacy’s father told her she’s valueless and her friend said her hair looked bad, so she’s on the prowl to continue the cycle of abuse and make someone else feel like a worthless whore.</p>

    <p>I wake up to find the word “Murder” written in blood by Macy reflected in the bathroom mirror. Lacy has taken the liberty of drawing a mustache and penis directly on the mirror. I don’t know what scares me more, the thought of where Macy got the blood, or the fact that someone could walk into the bathroom and if they looked at my reflection in the mirror at the right angle it would kinda look like I was a man.</p>

    <p>I decide that it’s time for me to fight back. I attempt to burn Macy to rid my room of her evil spirit, while simultaneously yelling compliments at Lacy in an attempt to kill her with kindness. Neither method appears to work, as Macy is one with the Devil and her evil soul is only fueled by flame, while Lacy’s internalized misogyny is so deep rooted that it would take years of therapy for her to be able to authentically accept a positive image of herself.</p>

    <p>Fearing for my life and also feeling a little left out of their friendship, I make the difficult choice to leave my haunted home.</p>
