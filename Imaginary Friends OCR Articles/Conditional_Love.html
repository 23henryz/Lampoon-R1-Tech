    <h3>Conditional Love</h3>

    <p>— Would you still date me if I had feet for hands and hands for feet?</p>

    <p>— Babe, I would love you even more because you’d be even more unique.</p>

    <p>— What if I had a disease that made my skin blue? Would you still date me then?</p>

    <p>— I don’t care if your skin is blue, white, ivory or beige.</p>

    <p>— What if I hated your dog, like, hypothetically? Maybe if I wanted to give it to a shelter?</p>

    <p>— I...I mean I guess I’d still date you yeah. But there’s no way you would actually do that haha.</p>

    <p>— Haha and what if I like, put him down this morning? And gave him a Hindu funeral?</p>

    <p>— Wait, what?</p>

    <p>— Would you still date me if I had a tail and spikes?</p>

    <p>— Yeah whatever, sure but I--I mean did you put down my dog? He’s not even spiritual why would you do that to him—</p>

    <p>— Would you still date me if I was a little kid?</p>

    <p>— Sure but my dog what the fuck did—</p>

    <p>— Woah.</p>

    <p>— ...</p>

    <p>— You’re fucked up. We’re done.</p>
