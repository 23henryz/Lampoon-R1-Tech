    <h3>Tiling a Roof for Dummies</h3>

    <p>The first step to tiling a roof is to find a ladder. Ladders aren’t creatures. Ladders aren’t in the wild. You must purchase a ladder with money at a store. I would go inside the store.</p>

    <p>I see that you’ve found a ladder. I would suggest not carrying it vertically above your head. I would suggest not carrying it horizontally below your feet like a skateboard. Why does your ladder not have holes? You must find another one before nightfall.</p>

    <p>You will now want to lean the ladder against the house. That is a mailbox. That is a little girl on a moving tricycle. Good, that is the house. Now just knock on the door and ask to retrieve the ladder from the window you just tossed it through. Great job.</p>

    <p>Climbing a ladder is the most difficult step after finding a ladder and leaning it against a house. You’re having trouble, so let’s approach it like you’re bear-crawling, not crab-walking, on vertical monkey-bars. As you begin one foot and hand after the other, resist the urge to clap in excitement. Woah, buster. Slow down. Like fine wine, ladders take time and don’t taste good.</p>

    <p>I’m sure your hands are getting clammy. My first time climbing an eight-foot ladder was also a slippery mess, which is how I got stuck on the second rung just like you are now. But there are strategies that can help, starting with not wiping your hands on your pants or each other at the same time. I thought this went without saying, but do not wipe your clammy hands on the ladder.</p>

    <p>Congrats on moving to the third rung. I got us breakfast. Did you get much sleep last night? Anyways, we definitely need to climb this ladder today. With you making little to no progress, I’ve hired a very strong man to put you on his shoulders and climb the ladder for you. His name is Gabriel. You don’t know how to climb a ladder either? Jesus Christ. Get out of here, man.</p>

    <p>Yes, I understand there are stairs to the roof. You are not ready for stairs.</p>

    <p>I stacked twenty ladders on top of each other underneath your ladder to lift you to the roof. Whatever you do, don’t fall between the rungs into an 8-foot ladder hole. This should not be hard if you stay horizontal, which you didn’t, and now we have to call authorities. Once you’re out, you’ll have a short recovery time, but I’m telling you we have to climb this ladder before winter.</p>

    <p>Great job climbing the ladder, buddy. Now, you must tile the roof.</p>
