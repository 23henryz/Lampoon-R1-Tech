    <h3>School for the Blind</h3>

    <p>After my county redistricted all of the public high schools, the only option I had was to attend the local school for the blind. In the beginning, I was pretty hyped. I could finally wear my cool sunglasses to school without getting shit from anybody. When classes started, I soon realized that mine were actually the least cool.</p>

    <p>I failed all my courses the first semester because my teachers insisted on giving me all of the assignments in braille. The other kids also constantly made fun of me for being able to see and refused to let me sit with them in the cafeteria. They called me things like “tuna breath” and “elephant steps” as they couldn’t make fun of any of my visible attributes.</p>

    <p>My extracurriculars didn’t help. As the sole member of the bird watching, cloud watching, and visual arts clubs, I spent most of my time alone. In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have founded so many clubs that involved looking at things.</p>

    <p>I was even more unlucky in my romantic life. Even though plenty of girls gave me “the eyes,” none of them actually liked me. When I asked my crush out on a date, she felt my face for fifteen seconds and then told me that she “really wasn’t looking for anything serious.”</p>

    <p>I only truly felt like I belonged in the school’s athletics program, where I made history by being named first-team-all-conference in Blind Soccer, Blind Basketball, and Blind Archery. I also received a lot of validation after I organized the first ever school-wide Pictionary competition. Nobody really gave me credit for winning it, though.</p>

    <p>Despite all the ups and downs, I wouldn’t have had it any other way. Even though I’m graduating with a 1.8 GPA and not attending college next year, I feel that I personally couldn’t have spent high school anywhere else. I also legally couldn’t, considering my transfer request was denied eighteen times in a row.</p>
