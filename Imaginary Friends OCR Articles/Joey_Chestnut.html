    <h3>Joey Chestnut</h3>

    <p>Joey Chestnut is a competitive eater and sixteen-time winner of the annual Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.</p>

    <p>I’m the Joey Chestnut of basketball.</p>

    <p>Now, I know what you’re thinking. Do I perhaps dunk basketballs in ranch before wolfing them down whole in twenty-four seconds flat?</p>

    <p>No. That would make me the Joey Chestnut of eating basketballs. I’m the Joey Chestnut of basketball.</p>

    <p>What does this mean? Picture Joey Chestnut with a hot dog in his hands. He’s about to swallow it whole. Now, replace that hot dog with a basketball, and imagine Joey Chestnut is not planning to eat it. That’s me. The Joey Chestnut of basketball.</p>

    <p>If you’re still confused, imagine Michael Jordan suspended two feet in the air, about to take the iconic game-winning shot in Game 5 of the 1989 Eastern Conference First Round Series between the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Now, replace Michael Jordan with Joey Chestnut. Are you starting to get the picture?</p>

    <p>Are you still confused? Let me give you a different example. Imagine that I am the Tiger Woods of steaks. Are you imagining Tiger Woods holding a tomahawk ribeye instead of a nine iron? If so, you’re really starting to get the hang of this.</p>

    <p>Now, replace Tiger Woods with Joey Chestnut, and replace the tomahawk ribeye with a basketball.</p>

    <p>If you’re still confused, don’t blame me. I never claimed to be the Joey Chestnut of explaining things well. I’m just the Joey Chestnut of basketball.</p>
