    <h1>My Plan for the Government</h1>

    <p>The government could stand to be a little less serious. Have you ever tried telling the government a joke? Most of the time, it doesn’t even laugh. Most of the time it just keeps on chugging along the complex workings of a giant bureaucracy. One time I totally killed it with my Borat impression though. Here is a typical attempt to tell a killer joke to the normal, boring, government:</p>

    <p>Me: Knock knock.</p>
    <p>Government: To call DMV, press 1, to call the Mayor’s Office, press 2, to hear this in Spanish…</p>
    <p>Me: Interrupting Cow.</p>
    <p>Government: ¡Para llamar al DMV, presione 1, para llamar a la Oficina del Alcalde, presione 2, para escuchar estas instrucciones nuevamente en inglés!</p>
    <p>Me: [simultaneously] Moooooooooo.</p>
    <p>Government: Eh.</p>

    <p>I’m sorry, I’m a person trying to make jokes, which increases joy, which I thought was supposed to be the goal of the government in the first place. Turns out, the goal of the government is to give you a bunch of paperwork so they can collect your signature in case you get famous.</p>

    <p>In my view, the government should try to be more funny. What if the IRS, instead of selling your house and recouping their losses exactly, lit your pants on fire, shit in your wallet, and made your uncle handicapped? This would make life, which can be quite dreary, remarkably more interesting. In the ancient days, when the government was mad at you, they’d just bang your wife and bury you halfway in the ground while throwing stones at your face. This is hilarious.</p>

    <p>Here’s a little breakdown of how the two types of government stack up:</p>

        <tr>
            <th>Serious Government</th>
            <th>Funny Governenment</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Politicians sexually harass staff.</td>
            <td>Even when they sexually harass, it’s tasteful. They use words like “bidonkadonk”. They take female members of staff and blow raspberries on their belly.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Military plays the song “Funky Town” sparingly, even during the seizure of a Taliban village in Funkytown, Afghanistan.</td>
            <td>Everywhere in Afghanistan, even among the least funky residents and municipalities, “Funkytown” can be heard.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>“I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”</td>
            <td>Bill Clinton would be the same.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The DMV’s a bitch.</td>
            <td>“I’m sorry, I thought this was the Department of Motor Vehicles, not the Department of Making Very funny jokes - because that’s what just happened!”</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>We have an expensive but effective healthcare system that can take care of most citizens.</td>
            <td>The IVs are made of gumballs! The doctors have banana pants! (death is rampant)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
