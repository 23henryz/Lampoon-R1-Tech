    <h3>Circus Human Resources</h3>

    <p>Thanks for coming, everyone. I’m Daniel, the new HR officer for the circus. First things first, we’re going to be changing the way we address each other. The term “ringmaster” calls back images of North American chattel slavery and “circus freaks” is disrespectful to our performers. We’ll be using the terms ring-supervisor and valued team-members from now on.</p>

    <p>Several county officials have complained to me that there are new animal-based diseases that are originating from the circus and spreading around the local community. In other words, some of you are clearly having sex with the animals. On record, I don’t condone this behavior. Off record, I’m providing condoms and other contraceptives right outside my office. Yes, Arthur, the animals can wear them too. (Crowd applauds.)</p>

    <p>In other news, we are unfortunately going to have to let go of Johnny 1, Johnny 2, and our bearded lady Alma. Apparently if you’re able to perform the operation, you are legally obligated to separate Siamese twins. We’ve essentially kept the two Johnnys attached at the hip for six more years than they had to be.</p>

    <p>As for Alma, she can no longer perform the bearded lady act because it’s totally normal for women to have beards now. Continuing the act would be suggesting that beards are only for heteronormative cis-male identifiers. Alma, stop complaining, we’ve got a job at the quarry lined up for you.</p>

    <p>Why is everyone talking at once? Less than all of you are losing your jobs. Look at Tom. Tom is going to keep his job as a knife-thrower. He’ll be throwing magnetic darts starting today. Tom, you will still need to sign all thirty-six waivers. Anybody else want to ask me something?</p>

    <p>(Someone shouts from the crowd.) I’m sorry but there’s no room in the budget for healthcare. We had to spend all our savings on our human-cannonball-turned-paraplegic’s medical bills. He’s now just the human-ball. Legally speaking, it’s our fault only his legs got shot out of the cannon.</p>
