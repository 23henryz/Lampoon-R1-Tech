    <h3>Second Grade</h3>

    <p>The most important parts of second grade are learning to read and also learning how to clean stains off of the walls without scratching them because the janitor seems to think that I am next in line for his job.</p>

    <p>It started when he hijacked the loudspeaker on the first day of school. He was like “Aaron, come to the janitor’s closet on the second floor. Walk alone and tell no one. Also don’t forget a hall pass.” When I got there he had set up a fog machine and had a banner that said “Welcome Aar” because he had misjudged the size of his letters. Then he started going on about “secret order” that was “thousands of years old” and how “the school board is out to get me. I’m the only thing standing in between this school and utter obliteration” and how “the most important part of being a janitor is deciding who lives and who dies.” Then, before I could move to stop him, he picked me up and threw me in a mop bucket. “Consider that your baptism.”</p>

    <p>Sometimes he loses his temper, but it’s just because he cares. Once, when I was walking to the class where we learn numbers and sounds, he looked me straight in the eyes and said “You don’t have what it takes.” Then he picked me up by the shoulders and shook me around a bunch in front of all the other kids and adults. Later, he apologized to me by breaking into my locker and replacing my lunch with a bottle of bleach on which he wrote “I’m sorry I lashed out, it’s just that you’re the last hope we have.”</p>

    <p>Last week, he slipped a note into my lunchbox which said “You’re almost ready.” Then when I was walking to the bathroom he slipped a plastic bag over my head and dragged me to his janitorial closet. I was totally suffocating though, and he seemed to get lost on the way to the closet, so I had to get resuscitated by the PE teacher when he left me on the floor for a bit while he was fumbling for his keys. Then he sat me in a chair in the closet next to like 40 mops and gave me a whole speech about how the role of the janitor is mostly about being able to handle “the psychological toll of seeing your friends die in action,” and how I better be ready for that.</p>

    <p>Then the walls started to tremble, and some dust came down from the ceiling. “They’re here. Your time has come,” he told me. “You have to do this without me, because I’m moving to Las Vegas to become a janitor there. And remember, the best way to clean is just to mix all the chemicals together and then spray them all around the school and leave them there forever. Don’t ever wipe anything up.” And then, just like that, he shrunk down and transformed into a “Caution Wet Floor” sign.</p>
