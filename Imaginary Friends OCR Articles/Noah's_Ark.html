    <h3>Noah's Ark</h3>

    <p>—Hey dad? Can we talk about the animals?</p>
    
    <p>—The animals?</p>
    
    <p>—You know. The two of each animal from every single species on Earth that live with us in the ark?</p>
    
    <p>—Oh, the animals. What about them?</p>
    
    <p>—Well, they’ve been having a lot of sex. Like, everywhere.</p>
    
    <p>—I know. Good.</p>
    
    <p>—I just thought they weren’t supposed to do that until after the flood.</p>
    
    <p>—Flood? Oh. No. I just made that up so your mom wouldn’t complain.</p>
    
    <p>—Why are we outside? Let’s go back inside. I want to see what those animals are up to.</p>
