        <p>Contrary to popular belief, sex isn't something that just exists in the movies. It happens to real people, every single day. I should know—I'm bisexual, which means that I've had sex two times.</p>
        <p>"Sex" derives from the Latin word "woo-hoo!" which isn’t etymologically related to "sex," but is something that I like to say during it. The first people to have sex were Adam and Eve, and the next person to have sex was Marilyn Monroe. My mom and dad have never had sex. Some people call the sex act "making love," but I think it makes a lot more sense to say "making sex."</p>
        <p>There are many different kinds of sex. Sex between a man and a woman. Sex between a rock and a hard place. Even sex between me and you, maybe. Sadly, not all of these kinds of sex will become reality. But a boy can dream. Sex dream.</p>
        <p>To me, the best parts of sex are the feeling and the overall experience. But I also like the high-fives I give myself, as well as all the looks I get from people in public who can tell that I've had sex because they are currently watching me have it. One time, I thought I was having sex, but it turned out I was just typing on my keyboard really fast. I'm careful about that now.</p>
        <p>It's important to use protection when having sex, so I always invite the United States Secretary of Defense. If he's too busy, which is most or all of the time, I'll usually just invite a lesser cabinet member, which is how I've become so intimate with the Secretary of the Interior—I don't mind her interior, if y'know what I mean (*wink*)! I mean our nation's public lands.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, though, sex is really what you make it. It can be good, or it can be not that. The possibilities are endless—kind of like religion, or breadsticks, which are some other things that sex can be. But, as cool as sex is, it's important for you to remember that, no matter what, it's never too late to become a virgin.</p>
