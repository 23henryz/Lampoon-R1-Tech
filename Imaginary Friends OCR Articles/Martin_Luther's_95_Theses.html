    <h3>Martin Luther's 95 Theses</h3>

    <p>1. No more shall the Pope sell plots in Heaven to the wealthy.</p>
    <p>2. No more shall we worship idols, or pray to another in place of the Lord.</p>
    <p>88 theses later…</p>
    <p>90. No more… no more… shoot. No more when someone writes a long proclamation shall they start by numbering it in huge ink letters. The number may be too ambitious. Five is a very reasonable number.</p>
    <p>91. For this one, my criticism shall be too many pointy things! No more shall churches have so many pointy things atop them that we confuse them with mountains or very pointy trees! Amen.</p>
    <p>93. No more shall we participate in the selling of priestly testicles to the wretched… if this is happening. I have never heard of it happening, but if it is, it should not be. Obviously.</p>
    <p>94. FREE SPACE! Write here what you think was not included in the previous 93 theses: _________________________. </p>
    <p> 95. No more shall we number our long proclamations without getting a broad sketch of all our ideas beforehand.</p>
