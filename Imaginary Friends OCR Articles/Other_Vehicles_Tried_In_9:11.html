    <h3>Other Vehicles Tried In 9/11</h3>

    <p>Hot Air Balloon: Luckily, a keen observer spotted the ballooners and prevented the tragedy by gently sticking a pole out of the window.</p>

    <p>Wheelie Shoes: Okay a wheelie is barely different from a normal shoe. How could this go wrong? Unfortunately, both wheelie shoes were hijacked and diverted to a field in Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p>Bomb-toting Camel Caravan: You may think this is obvious, but in today’s New York you see stuff like this all the time. Like if you saw it on the street you probably wouldn’t even point. Sad.</p>

    <p>Eagles: A couple of terrorists from Deathmanistan, who would expect them to come riding on... a bald eagle?? Unfortunately, eagles are genetically incapable of killing Americans. Instead, they hightailed it back to Deathmanistan to spread freedom and political instability. Awesome!</p>

    <p>Skateboard: Osama hit an ollie, tanked a fifteen-stair, and totally shredded it down the side of this one tower, man. While no one died, the trick was dope enough to convince America to retreat completely from world affairs.</p>
