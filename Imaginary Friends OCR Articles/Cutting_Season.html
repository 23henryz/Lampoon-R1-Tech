    <h3>Cutting Season</h3>

    <p>- Oh Derek, you look... different.</p>
    <p>- Yeah I’ve been cutting weight. I’m almost seventy pounds now.</p>
    <p>- That’s skinny, man. That’s too skinny.</p>
    <p>- Yeah, thanks. My hair and height cut is going great too.</p>
    <p>- Height and hair? What do you mean?</p>
    <p>- You know, I got my spine shrunk and my hair follicles removed. Cutting season!</p>
    <p>- Oh my god, yeah. You look extremely short and bald.</p>
    <p>- Yeah and look, no eyelashes. Gosh, I can’t wait for them to grow back even stronger.</p>
    <p>- No, Teddy, you just cut weight... The height and hair, man, that’s irreplaceable.</p>
    <p>- Oh my god. But my mom’s leg. Surely my mom’s leg will grow back!?</p>
    <p>- You cut off your mom’s leg! Why would that even make sense?</p>
    <p>- You nodded when you told me about this! You nodded in a way that made it clear I should do this!</p>
    <p>- What? How could a nod confer so much detail??</p>
    <p>- Oh you know what. It was totally another guy that nodded. And he was just saying “yes.”</p>
    <p>- Your scalp. It’s bleeding.</p>
    <p>- Okay, I messed up. Alright? You got me.</p>
