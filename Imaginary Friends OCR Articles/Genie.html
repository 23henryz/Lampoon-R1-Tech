    <p>– Wait, wait. I thought I wished for a Ferrari.</p>
    <p>– This is Ferrari, the most beautiful prostitute in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
    <p>– That’s not what I meant. I want a Ferrari. Like, the car.</p>
    <p>– I do not understand. Do you wish for me to behead Ferrari?</p>
    <p>– No, no! She’s great! I love Ferrari! I just also want a real Ferrari.</p>
    <p>– To love a prostitute is a dangerous game. It has been the downfall of many a sultan.</p>
    <p>– Just give me a normal, red Ferrari supercar. The one with 600 horsepower.</p>
    <p>– Here. This is Princess Alara. Her dowry comes with 6,000 horses.</p>
    <p>– I don’t want to marry Princess Alara. And what am I going to do with all these horses?</p>
    <p>– I know you lust for Ferrari, but wedding Alara will do much to secure peace with her father to the east. You may keep Ferrari in your harem, should you desire.</p>
    <p>– Okay, listen, it doesn’t even need to be a Ferrari. Just give me something sturdy I can get around in, like a Nissan, or a bike. No princesses, no prostitutes.</p>
    <p>– I can give you all the princesses and prostitutes in Arabia.</p>
    <p>– Fine.</p>
