    <h3>Lies To Tell Your Children About How Their Fish Died</h3>

    <p>The loss of a pet is always hard on small children, especially when the pet didn’t die and instead just grew apart from the family because they kept asking him if they could borrow cash and so he decided it was time to pack up and move on. Here’s some ideas for things to say:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>He drowned</li>
        <li>I ate him</li>
        <li>You ate him</li>
        <li>He blew up</li>
        <li>He fell down the stairs</li>
        <li>He was pushed down the stairs</li>
        <li>He committed suicide by throwing himself down the stairs</li>
        <li>He OD’d on Molly, but he was totally off the wall right before, like really he was having the time of his life.</li>
        <li>He was run over by a remote-control monster truck</li>
        <li>Killed by a bigger, cooler fish who had slicked back hair and a leather jacket</li>
        <li>He got drafted to fight in Vietnam and then while he was there the CIA realized he was a communist and they executed him by shooting him out of a cannon</li>
        <li>A toaster fell into his fish tank while he was trying to make you guys breakfast in bed</li>
        <li>You stopped believing in him</li>
        <li>The very thin wire suspending a piano in the air broke and then the piano fell but he dodged it but then an anvil fell on him while he was celebrating dodging the piano</li>
        <li>A burglar broke into the house and stole only him and nothing else</li>
        <li>I’ll tell you about it later</li>
        <li>Have you heard about the Twin Towers?</li>
    </ol>
