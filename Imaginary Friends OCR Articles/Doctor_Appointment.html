    <h3>Doctor Appointment</h3>

    <p>- Hello, Jim. I am Doctor Van Helsing.</p>

    <p>- Ha. You must get a lot of Dracula jokes.</p>

    <p>- Jokes? Oh, no, no, dear boy, Dracula is no laughing matter. He is a brutal, vile murderer.</p>

    <p>- Yeah, that’s cool. Anyways, I’ve been having a lot of anxiety lately.</p>

    <p>- How could you not? It is frightening to live in a world where a creature like Dracula roams free.</p>

    <p>- Totally, totally. Do you have anything for anxiety? Something I could smoke, maybe?</p>

    <p>- I have these cloves of garlic. I prefer to keep them around my neck, but I suppose you could smoke them. In fact, doing so could make the very air around you poisonous to the beast, preventing him from ever coming near.</p>

    <p>- Mhmm. Wow. I don’t know if that’s really what I’m looking for.</p>

    <p>- Alas, you are correct. Tempting as it may be, I cannot content myself with merely keeping Dracula away. It is my duty to lure him to my wooden stake, and put an end to his reign of darkness once and for all!</p>

    <p>- Marijuana. I want marijuana. Can you help me out or not?</p>

    <p>- Oh, of course. I personally smoke a great, great deal of pot.</p>

    <p>HTM</p>
