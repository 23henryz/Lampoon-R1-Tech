    <h3>The Good Gatsby</h3>

    <p>The year was the Jazz Age. New York was the entire world, and Paris was at the center of it all. I was a wide-eyed and jaded Ivy League graduate’s uneducated drinking buddy, disillusioned with life, death, love, hate, us, them, and the concept of disillusionment itself—in other words, I was just like everybody else.</p>

    <p>I first saw him in a dream, in which he looked nothing like he did in reality and a lot more like a dalmatian that was purple and also a bird. Years later, when we finally met at a random cocktail party, I knew his name before he even said it, since the person introducing us had already said it: The Good Gatsby. Though I was initially perplexed by his strange moniker, The Good Gatsby laid all my questions to rest by explaining that his name was highly unusual.</p>

    <p>Many a night, we would talk for hours, often to different people, but occasionally with each other. For a time, I even loved The Good Gatsby, yet the things he would say to me, such as “I like you only as a friend” and “ayo bro stop kissing me,” sometimes made me wonder whether he felt the same way. Eventually, I gave up, and began loving trains, as all men do.</p>

    <p>I often suspected that The Good Gatsby had a hidden past, though he would only ever tell me of his very well-known past that contained a great deal of romance, deception, intrigue, and betrayal. And there was no one who featured more prominently in that past than The Good Gatsby, since it was his past and all. But the person who featured the second-most prominently in that past was Laura.</p>

    <p>It was said that the only things that could hurt The Good Gatsby were Laura and physical harm. She was as beautiful as Niagara Falls, but also a lot prettier than that since she was a lady and not a waterfall. I never really got to know Laura, on account of all the time I spent down at the railroad tracks watching trains and trying to touch them, but to The Good Gatsby, she was the sun, the moon, and the stars. I think he had a crush on her.</p>

    <p>Alas, things took a turn for the worse when Laura killed herself via suicide. The town wept, but, curiously, The Good Gatsby did not shed a tear. Then I asked him whether he had heard that Laura died, and he broke down sobbing. It must have been the way I said it. I tried to console him by reminding him that suicide was illegal, so Laura was basically a filthy criminal who did not deserve to be mourned and who was probably currently burning in the pits of Hell, but even that could not make his grief subside.</p>

    <p>I did not see The Good Gatsby much after that. He stopped throwing parties, but that was not much of a departure from the status quo, since he had only ever thrown, like, two parties, both poorly-attended. Ultimately, I moved out to Hollywood and became a famous dancer or politician. But the lessons I had learned—grit, truth, and good luck—would stay with me forever. And I know that, somewhere out there, The Good Gatsby feels the exact same way.</p>
