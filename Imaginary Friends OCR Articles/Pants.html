    <h3>Pants</h3>

    <p>I spend most of my time with my other pant-leg. But my twin doesn’t hold a candle to the leg I wrap around. His name is “Right” but I call him “Friend.”</p>

    <p>When I’m with my leg, my fit is too tight to be described with words, other than “Skinny Jean, 30.” We will never forget each other. I have faded to his knees every contour, and in return I have peppered his pores with small, cancerous, microplastics.</p>

    <p>I tried to make our relationship sexual, but I couldn’t deal with the fact that I wasn’t the only one he wore. I knew it wasn’t his decision (damn that Brain!) but even so, I couldn’t get over my jealousy or distrust knowing how he was talking to the other pants. I’m just his jeans, he’s got, at least, 1 other pair of pants, the “slutty sweats” I call ‘em.</p>

    <p>On the day I ripped, right in the buttock, I knew it was over. There was no way the hands knew how to mend something like that. From my view of the dumpster when he walked away, I could tell those sweatpants were laughing with every swish.</p>
