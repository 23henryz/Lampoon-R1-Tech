    <h3>Pebis</h3>

    <p>First time I met Pebis was when I woke up and he was sitting directly on my chest. I thought it was sleep paralysis until he started furiously punching my abdomen. “These things need work,” he said. “You’ll never get laid with this flab.”</p>

    <p>“What?”</p>

    <p>“Name’s Pebis. Like Bebis with a P, or Pebin with an S. Also like the phrase ‘Feel The Bern’ if you take out some letters and rearrange others, and also add some. God sent me to be your imaginary friend to make sure you get some.”</p>

    <p>When I got to school, Pebis was standing behind my desk, all tall and brooding. He smelled like Fritos and also water, somehow. When I sat down, he hairsprayed my hair into a big heart, and then gave me glasses that said “2010” on them, except the eye holes were in the 2 and the 1.</p>

    <p>“If these changes don’t get the ball rolling, God is going to shoot me with a gun. He calls it ‘The Pleasuremaker.’ It’s big and has a bunch of wet blood and anthrax on it. You don’t want me to get shot with that thing, do you kid? That’s what I thought. Now get out there, tiger.”</p>

    <p>Pebis then kicked me in the back, sending me hurtling towards Jessica, the most beautiful girl in the third grade.</p>

    <p>“Oh… hey Jessica. I was just wondering if—”</p>

    <p>“I’ll stop you right there,” Jessica said. “Who’s that hot hunka hunka you’re with?”</p>

    <p>“Sorry kid,” Pebis sighed. “This always happens. Also, I too am in third grade, so this isn’t weird. We are all third graders. Afraid this is the last straw for me though. I’ve disappointed the big man one too many times. Sayonara.” Then, just like that, God appeared and pulled out a gun, but it was a normal gun, not The Pleasuremaker.</p>

    <p>“What? That’s not The Pleasuremaker!” Pebis cried.</p>

    <p>“The Pleasuremaker is in the shop because I dropped it in a hole.” God said. “This one’s gonna hurt!” Then God shot Pebis 4000 times.</p>

    <p>So yeah, I guess I do believe in God.</p>
