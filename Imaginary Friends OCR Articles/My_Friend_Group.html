    <h3>My Friend Group</h3>

    <p>Janey was a hot-shot soccer goalie with a propensity to vape in the bathroom. Tim smoked weed between classes but in a subtle way that implied he was embarrassed about it. Mike was generous with his compliments and always had a free house. Together, we were unstoppable.</p>

    <p>Every day, I’d get to the cafeteria a few minutes early and stake out a table in the back corner. I knew my crew had arrived once there was a small gust of wind and a tingling feeling in my chest. Janey, ever the busy bee, usually arrived a few minutes late. She’d always say she was at imaginary practice, but I knew she was actually imaginary vaping in the bathroom.</p>

    <p>The gang and I would sit together at our lunch table, bantering among ourselves as students and administrators periodically dropped by to ask if I was doing ok. Occasionally, one of my classmates would ask if they could sit with me, and I would tell them no. I often feel misunderstood. People assume I’m shy, but I actually just have an insane superiority complex.</p>

    <p>Once lunch was over, I’d go back to class and continue speaking to no one. Again, it is difficult to interact with your acquaintances when they are so much more pathetic than your actual friends. Luckily, I have just decided that Mike is transferring to all of my classes; I’m expecting lots of belly laughs and cheeky glances in the coming days. Things are starting to look up. I can’t wait to see the imaginary things my gang and I accomplish one day.</p>
