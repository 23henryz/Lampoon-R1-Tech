    <h3>President’s Assistant</h3>

    <p>I’m the president’s assistant. That’s right. Mr. POTUS. The man who decorates the oval office. When I walk with the president, I walk behind him, but just one or two steps, in case he falls backwards after slipping on a baseball and I need to catch him.</p>

    <p>Whenever he needs advice, I’m there. “What should I do about this war?” He asks me and only me. “Make it so that when they throw the baseball faster than 20mph it’s a federal crime and the baseball gets executed,” I say. I’m a genius. He knows it. Sometimes I give him other advice. “What if we had bombs that could fly and then explode?” I suggest. “We have those, they’re called missiles,” he says. I knew it was a good idea.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I need to write speeches for him, like on important holidays such as the 4th of July, or his birthday, or my birthday. Here’s part of the 4th of July speech:</p>

    <p>“When I look out on these good people, on these good lands, I think about how when I was little, a baseball hit me right in the stomach and I was bleeding like all over the place and I had to have my pancreas removed and they gave it to my bully, who was born without a pancreas. He bullied me even harder after he got his new pancreas because it was a bad pancreas that got hit by a baseball.”</p>

    <p>He didn’t use it, because it was too genius. “They just wouldn’t understand, my little genius” he says while holding my face between his hands. He looks at my lips. There’s something there.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, when he’s taking a thinking bath, he needs help with writing policy. “What should I do about all of these taxes?” He asks me. “That’s not important at all,” I tell him. “We should change the rules of baseball. The first rule should be to always have fun. The second rule should be to stop bleeding on the field. The third rule is when bees are on the field all of the baseball players get guns and the game can’t resume until all the bees are dead.”</p>

    <p>Politics are hard, because you have to talk to a lot of old people and sometimes they’ll die right there mid-conversation, so then you have to start talking to another one and it’s like 50/50 whether it will happen again. Also, sometimes baseball lobbyists break into your office and they’ll force you to chant “baseball” and make you chew tobacco and spit it out onto photos of the president.</p>

    <p>It’s the worst.</p>
