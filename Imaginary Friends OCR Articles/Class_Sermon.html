    <h3>Class Sermon</h3>

    <p>Classmates, I’ve chosen to give my student sermon on the topic of friendship. Now, please don’t quote me on this, but the Bible almost certainly mentions some variation of the word “friend” at least ten times. At least one of those times has to say something positive about the power of friendship. Now, the internet in my house has been wonky, so I can’t verify either of these things through an automated search-and-replace mechanism. I will just ask you to trust me on this one.</p>

    <p>What I can tell you is this: The Bible demonstrates the power of friendship to all of us through its stories. The Bible tells us that for being such a busy guy, Jesus rarely ate alone. Da Vinci even suggests that he had more than ten friends eat with him on one occasion. If Jesus could make time for others in his life, those outside of his family, then we all can too.</p>

    <p>Some of you might not have friends. Weird Tommy certainly doesn’t. We all have one imaginary friend though. Yep: Jesus Christ. Now, Mrs. Meyerson, I’ll ask that you let me finish before you interject about how imaginary Jesus is or is not. Frankly, I don’t think that’s for you or for me to say. But if I may say anything, it’s that Jesus can be an imaginary friend to all of us.</p>

    <p>Imagine him next to you. If you have trouble doing this, refer to the images around the room of our lord and savior. These images leave little room for the imagination, but I implore your minds to imagine to a degree larger than just a loincloth or even a white robe. Imagine what you two could be talking about. That’s right, Angela, Christianity is something that you and Jesus could talk about. You seemingly both enjoy, loathe, or at the very least, tolerate it. That’s more than our mayor down the road can say. Can I get an amen for that? Amen.</p>

    <p>You can imagine so much more with your friend Jesus though. Jesus can introduce you to his other friends. Soon enough, you’ll be the coolest person in all of your world, or you’ll have the most friends - whichever definition suits this sermon best. The point is this: the Bible probably talks about friendship.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Meyerson, may I please be excused? I have lunch plans. Yes, Angela, Jesus will be there. He’s everywhere. Right, Mrs. Meyerson?</p>
