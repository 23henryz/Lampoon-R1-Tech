        <p>Interviewer: Now Mr. Dylan, tell me: what’s it like being named Boob?</p>

        <p>Bob Dylan: Once again, that is not correct. My name is Bob.</p>

        <p>Interviewer: I’m sorry what—you’re just regular Bob? Fuck.</p>

        <p>Bob Dylan: I’m Bob Dylan. It’s a pretty big deal that I agreed to do this.</p>

        <p>Interviewer: Got it. It’s B-o-b. Okay. This may not be crazy enough for our viewers. Is your house made out of flames or something?? Or do you skateboard, do you love extreme skateboarding so much it makes you want to blow your brains out???</p>

        <p>Bob Dylan: I’m just a folk musician. I revolutionized American folk music.</p>

        <p>Interviewer: Okay. Jesus. We really thought he was named Boob, viewers out there. Hmmmm. Well tell us, what would it have been like <em>if</em> you were named Boob?</p>

        <p>Bob Dylan: I wouldn’t have made it big, that’s for sure. But maybe that’s the life I wanted all along. Probably would have stayed in Minnesota and found a girl who loved me for me. We would have had a farm. It would have been quiet, but nice. You know, sometimes I think this whole thing, this music career, has been a psychosis consuming a human life—</p>

        <p>Interviewer: Alright. Um. Great. We now turn to a man we just found live on air whose actual name is Boob Buttkiss. Mr. Buttkiss it’s a pleasure to have you on.</p>

        <p>Boob Buttkiss: A pleasure to be here.</p>

        <p>Bob Dylan: Is that it? I flew from Los Angeles for this.</p>

        <p>Interviewer: Tell me, Mr. Buttkiss. Do you put your pants on one leg at a time, like some sort of regular man, or do you prefer another method?</p>

        <p>Boob Buttkiss: I’m glad you asked me that, Paul.</p>
