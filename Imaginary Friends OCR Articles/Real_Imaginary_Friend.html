    <h3>Real Imaginary Friend</h3>

    <p>My imaginary friend isn’t imaginary, he’s just very good at staying hidden. Everybody else thinks he’s imaginary, and I feel like I’m going fucking insane. This guy just likes messing with me and is really sneaky.</p>

    <p>I first met my real imaginary friend in the middle of the night when I woke up and he was sitting on my chest. He grabbed my face and asked me if I had his gold, but in a sort of riddle-style. Like, “where lies my gold? Betwixt your feet! When you lay your head down to sleep: That’s when I will come for you, and take what’s mine, that old statue” or something like that.</p>

    <p>I told him I didn’t have his gold, but he said by then he had already grown fond of me. So now he kinda just horses around. He likes to sneak up behind the person I’m talking to and start making all sorts of weird faces and pointing at them, and then when I shout “turn around! Do you see that?” He’s somehow disappeared again, and I seem very rude. Everyone has stopped having conversations with me.</p>

    <p>Whenever people’s backs are turned, he shrieks and then crouches behind me. When people turn around and ask if I’m okay, I have to say yes and pretend like I have the scream of an inconspicuous 3 foot tall middle-aged man with a combover and a charitable demeanor toward the unhoused. He’s not all bad.</p>

    <p>When no one else is around we actually get along pretty well. I’ve introduced him to things from my world, like baseball and beer, and he’s shown me stuff from his life, like riddles and social manipulation. Turns out the gold he was talking about was a local Emmy that he won a few years ago for investigative journalism, before he gave it all up for a life of whimsy.</p>

    <p>Despite our tenuous friendship, I’m kind of hoping my real imaginary friend finds someone else to harass soon. Life is already difficult enough as a schizophrenic male virgin of 45.</p>
