    <h3>Zarolence</h3>

    <p>Zarolence is a new medicine that makes you immortal. Below is the six-week follow-up form.</p>

    <p>Have you experienced any symptoms since receiving Zarolence?</p>

    <ul>
        <input type="checkbox"> No. </br>
        <input type="checkbox"> Yes. I am completely viscous. I look, act, move, and feel like a human puddle.
    </ul>

    <p>If you responded “yes” above, which describes your symptoms? Check all that apply.</p>

    <ul>
        <input type="checkbox"> Loss of hearing, vision, limbs, and torso; sticky; when I shuffle across sidewalks, I lose myself down sewers, in cracks, and evaporate into clouds for days at a time; more pain; then even more pain. </br>
        <input type="checkbox"> Cough. </br>
        <input type="checkbox"> I drift profoundly into unconsciousness, unable to associate experience with meaning. I occasionally awake to glimpses of my children starving or doctors poking my puddle skin. I pray I’ll stay conscious long enough to hold my newborn triplets just once before I slip away again.
    </ul>

    <p>What methods, if any, help you mitigate these symptoms? Check all of them.</p>

    <ul>
        <input type="checkbox"> I can hold loose items for friends with my new buoyancy. This would give meaning if I had any friends left. It’s never enough. </br>
        <input type="checkbox"> My mom keeps me in consistent form by sucking me into a bendy straw. This would give me something. </br>
        <input type="checkbox"> Nothing works. My pain is now molecular. My drops are spreading. I am everywhere. I am everything. I hear everything. Am I dead? Or am I God? Can be both?
    </ul>

    <p>Are you interested in being the spokesperson for Zarolence?</p>

    <ul>
        <input type="checkbox"> I am not.
    </ul>

    <p>After taking Zarolence, do you still want to live forever?</p>

    <ul>
        <input type="checkbox"> Yes. But even if I wanted to say no, could I die? How do you kill something like me? Would each individual molecule of mine have to be killed for my consciousness to dissipate? Or could one molecule, stuck to the bottom of an unassuming shoe, prevent my deepest lust for nothingness? What happens at the end of time? Do I persist? Is this the worst thing to ever happen to anyone? </br>
        <input type="checkbox"> No.
    </ul>
