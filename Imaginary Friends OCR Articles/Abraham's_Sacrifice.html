    <h3>Abraham's Sacrifice</h3>

    <p>God: Abraham, I need you to kill your firstborn son. Do not ask me why.</p>

    <p>Abraham: Oh, kill Paul? Sure.</p>

    <p>God: Feel free to take more time. This is a pretty big decision. A real test of faith.</p>

    <p>Abraham: If you want, I could just kill him now and bring him to the sacrifice place.</p>

    <p>God: I’m sorry, is something going on between you and your son?</p>

    <p>Abraham: He’s just so lazy. Here check this out. Hey, Paul. PAUL!</p>

    <p>Paul: Ugh. WHAT IS IT DAD?!</p>

    <p>Abraham: See? The kid has no zest for life.</p>

    <p>God: That’s no reason to kill him!</p>

    <p>Abraham: I feel like you’re giving me mixed signals here.</p>

    <p>God: Alright, fine. Bring him. And, uh, reflect. Reflect deeply.</p>

    <p>Abraham: Okay. Dead! Irrevocably dead. I just killed him.</p>

    <p>God: What?! You didn’t even give me time to interject and give a speech!</p>

    <p>Abraham: I know. I was so scared you’d stop me. I had to kill Paul.</p>
