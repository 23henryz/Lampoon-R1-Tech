    <h3>My Rapping Days</h3>

    <p>When I first started rapping, it was just me, Deja Vu, Smoke, Sean KILLA, and the E_COLI crew. Deja Vu caught my attention after releasing an experimental mixtape made out of sticks—nothing like the conventional mixtapes being made at the time. Smoke was part of Penis Posse which was loosely affiliated with the Clown consortium, a subdivision of Independent Entrepreneur Hip Hop, which was the catch-phrase of this guy Derek Hallworthy, a friend of mine who actually ran DEF JAM records—which is a fairly big label, at least at the time—anyway he partly owned a Chevron dealership right next to my house, which is where I accidentally met Smoke one time. Meanwhile, I was working on another kind of sound: mixing the bold Afrofunk rhythms of the early 2000s with the virulent racism of the 1930s.</p>

    <p>I guess I thought I would become a famous rapper if I just partied, smoked, joined a gang, and had a large, profitable fanbase that liked me for rapping. Now Deja Vu’s dead. Killed by a Mormon gang called the Bad Boys. Smoke died long ago in a rap battle. And me? I ended up hitching my wagon to a restrictive religion that thought rapping was akin to Mongol gang sex. While they had a pretty strict view on rapping, they had a refreshingly liberal perspective on Mongol gang sex.</p>

    <p>In retrospect, we should’ve known we weren’t cut out for it. Smoke was just some smoke. Deja Vu was a Lutheran choir boy who hated rapping. The E_COLI crew was a group of two-thousand highly-dedicated men who would obey any order. In retrospect, I wish I had utilized them more. They ended up joining forces with Notorious Philosopher and HindSIGHT to form the Dark Earth gang. The Dark Earth gang is a group of two-thousand-and-two highly dedicated men.</p>

    <p>You might be wondering what happened to Sean KILLA, mentioned loosely at the beginning of this piece. Well that son-of-a-dog ended up getting into the best rap school this side of the country. Now he’s off to Malibu, to write songs about guns and love.</p>
