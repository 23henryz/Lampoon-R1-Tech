    <h3>Turtle</h3>

    <p>The best part about being a turtle is my shell. It is my home. It is also a sort of Schrödinger situation where it is impossible to prove whether I am alive.</p>

    <p>I like being in my shell because it is dark. I also like to make scary noises so when the ants walk by they think I am a cave and that I am haunted. I eat them. Ants are also tasty. Silly ants, they are so dumb and afraid. I eat them. Ants are also tasty.</p>

    <p>When I’m in my shell, sometimes my thoughts start closing in on me. I start thinking I should go out and face the world like my dad did. He was run over by a car—a stark reminder of what the shell cannot protect you from: Grief. But then again, he may still be alive. He was still inside his shell when it was ground into the pavement.</p>

    <p>I get good wifi in my shell, but I do not have enough room to bring a computer or phone in here with me. I hope that by losing some weight I can accomplish this. My shell will not grow, but I can shrink.</p>

    <p>In an effort to lose weight I am staying in my shell until further notice. According to Kenny’s phone, I should force myself to only eat salads, and cut down on all that fatty lettuce I was eating before. I am installing a doorbell on my shell to better receive deliveries. The deliveries will find me where I am sitting.</p>

    <p>*sigh* I think asking if I am alive or dead in my shell is the wrong question. I am usually asleep.</p>
