    <h3>Schlurps</h3>

    <p>—What is that little speck getting smaller and smaller?</p>

    <p>—Shoot, that’s the ark!</p>

    <p>—We missed the ark?</p>

    <p>—We gotta catch it. Noah told us that this was our last chance.</p>

    <p>—Yeah, after he lied about the docking location.</p>

    <p>—And locked us in that basement.</p>

    <p>—Maybe it’s good we missed the ark. You know, I don’t even want kids.</p>

    <p>—Yeah, but now there won’t be any schlurps after the flood.</p>

    <p>—What? A world without schlurps? No one will have our double stranded tail.</p>

    <p>—You’re thinking so superficially. What about our blind empathy for each and every creature?</p>

    <p>—What about our ginger fur?</p>

    <p>—This is a tragedy. No one’s going to have eyes.</p>

    <p>—I think the other animals have eyes.</p>

    <p>—Two of them?</p>

    <p>—A bunch of them, yeah.</p>

    <p>—Oh, ok.</p>
