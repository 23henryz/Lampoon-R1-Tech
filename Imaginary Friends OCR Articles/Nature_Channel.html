    <h3>Nature Channel</h3>

    <p>Dolphins are apparently so emotionally intelligent that they take turns stimulating each other’s blow holes to achieve orgasmic-like pleasure. Let’s take a look.</p>

    <p>-Whinny!<br>
    -Neigh!</p>

    <p>I’m so sorry. It appears we’ve shown you footage of the horse. As many of you, particularly those of you in the soundbooth right now, must know, it is in direct violation of our company policy to broadcast an image of the horse. We are a nature channel, and ever since man domesticated the horse several thousand years ago, it has ceased to exemplify the true ideal of Mother Nature.</p>

    <p>Picture a horse. What do you see? An armored carriage with a feathered tuft on its head ready to be led into slaughter by the man riding on its back? Only doofuses wear feathers. Or do you see a harnessed, soulless creature being forced to run in circles? That would be a mercy, if only horses’ knees let them turn. I’ll tell you what you really see. It’s industry and oppression. Being forced to watch a horse is worse than losing your job to a machine. Truly, I don’t know how we could have made such a grievous error.</p>

    <p>Brett from sound, you say? Where is he? Well, when Brett gets back, tell him I want a croissant, too, and then I want to see him in my office. Now viewers, before we indefinitely suspend our programming to get to the bottom of this shameful mistake by firing everyone involved, I will read you a list of words that you have requested to hear in my “deep, melodious British voice” over the years. Bubble. Stealthy. Choke. Pizzeria. Mother. Train. Illuminating. Pike.</p>

    <p>VG</p>
