    <h3>New Rules For Candyland</h3>

    <p>Standard Candy Land is too simple of a board game, with no strategy. Here are the rules I prefer to play with:</p>

    <p> - Youngest player goes last. <br>
        - To win, you must land exactly on the final tile. This requires drawing the “Final Tile” card.<br>
        - To add strategy, players can either decline or accept to move to the next tile.<br>
        - To add excitement, when it’s not your turn, you may talk about anything you’d like.<br>
        - Yellow tiles are “sticky.” If you land on one, you lose a turn. However, players can appeal for a second turn by passing the “Yellow Tile Sticky Quiz.” Each Yellow Tile Sticky Quiz is procedurally generated from a 200,000-factoid database of Candy Land lore. The quiz is graded on a 350-1600 point scale, including a timed Candy Math and Candy Reading section. Playing the test costs 75 Candy Dollars, and another 150 USD to send it to the Candy Board. If you obtain and wear “Test-Optional” Candy Cane Hat from the Candy Cane Woods, the house is required to not let your score affect their verdict. The Candy Cane Hat looks really stupid when you wear it.<br>
        - Red tiles are a homely bar where everyone knows your name. Beginner and intermediate players will be enticed to spend their younger days there, until the days don’t seem so young at all. Unfamiliar faces grow familiar in the cigarette smoke. The regulars come in after a long day at the Candy Plant—god knows how it wasn’t shut down decades ago, after the King Nutmeg administration. The workers are worn out, but are always up for a game of darts. Bill, in the corner booth, is there right from 5 o’clock every day. Some days, he even helps the manager swing the “Open” sign. Quiet afternoons grow into lively evenings and dive into lonely nights. In these wee hours, Bill confesses he’s never left the Red Tile. Someday, he wants to sail across the Gumdrop Sea and visit Bolivia. He had a lover once, but she left to find herself out in the real, non-candy world. She moved on, and he lingered in his dying hometown. Was that youth of his really so far away? When beer was cheap, and love was a sure promise. In the far back, the bar piano strings cloud with cigarette grit. The old songs play, but now they are old; childhood faces remain, but the young souls are gone. Suddenly, friends are not the people in your stories, but the people you tell stories to. Old Bill breaks down into tears. Thirty years pass and it’s you, and Donnie, and Louie from the Sprinkles car trade—the only souls who didn’t move on. Meaning is found just as soon as it is lost. Another round, on you.<br>
        - Level 50000 mages spawn according to a Gaussian distribution within a 64 millimeter radius of the Gumdrop Ocean, have 460-570 health points depending on Candy level, and are unaffected by Level 4 or lower mind-control. The house calculator (TI-84 or older) must recalculate their health stats every game tick, since they fluctuate as a function of how many mages they are near. The house calculator must be set to radians instead of degrees if they are on the West side of the map, due to the cultural differences in the parallel discovery of mathematics in Candy Land. West is determined by a combination of real-world West and magnetic North.<br>
        - Many Candy Land players are frustrated by the Gumdrop Bridge mechanic, in which there is a scary drawing of a lollipop monster underneath it. In this version, the lollipop monster has less-sharper teeth and a thought bubble that says, “I am not going to eat you.”<br>
        - Green tiles have a 50% chance of putting you into a Truman Show version of life where you’re still playing the Candy Land game, but the result of the game is meaningless and when it ends you’re just back on the Green Tile. Advanced players will immediately stand up out of their seats and look for cameras and hidden product placement. Common products to see advertised are Corn Flakes, Rutabaga Chips, and Triangle Paste—the “Only Paste That Is Made Of Triangles”. That clearly isn’t a thing in the real world, but with the growing Candy Land meta, you never know what stunts people will pull. Advanced retaliators in a Green Tile scenario will often mime these product placements to convince the Green Tile player that they are in a simulation. If convinced, the Green Tile’d player will often realize that the fastest way to return to real life is to kill themselves with the Candy Land gun, which unfortunately doesn’t come with the standard game. The Candy Land gun is sold by Hasbro Arms, which is also a Green Tile sponsor; thus one must be careful about shooting oneself, as it may subsidize Embedded Hasbro enough to develop the technology to climb out of its reality and interfere the one in which the Candy Land game is being played. If their technology advances at pace with the Hasbro in our reality, then players can expect a play time of 30-60 minutes before reality collapses.<br>
        - Pink tiles are bouncy.<br> </p>
